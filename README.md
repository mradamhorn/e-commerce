## Installation
As this program uses Node.js, Dotenv, MySql, and Sequalize dependencies, you will want to open an integrated terminal in the project folder to make sure those are installed. They should already be listed as dependencies in the package.json file. First, you'll need to make sure the dependancies are installed on your maching by typing "npm i" into the terminal. Then, install the node modules by typing "npm i" into the terminal. If those dependancies are not listed in the package.json file, you can add them by typing "npm i express", "npm i mysql", or "npm i sequelize" into the integrated terminal.

## Usage
As anyone who runs an e-commerce business knows, managing products and organizing by category and tags can get overwhelming at times. This is the back end structure to organize all that information in a sql database for better functionality to ensure an efficient e-commerce business.
